## Vanilla Bundle Webpack Demo

Standalone package to simply demo the Vanilla Bundle implementation (no framework associated), it also used to build the [GitHub Demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-universal) page and run the Cypress E2E tests.

This is basically a simple UI implementation written in plain TypeScript with Webpack bundler to demo most features. We also use this demo to run all our Cypress E2E tests.

### Installation
To get started with this demo, you need to run it from the root of monorepo structure.
Go to the root of the repo and follow the instructions provided in the main [README](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal#installation)
