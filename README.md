# Slickgrid-Universal

This is a copy of an old [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal) project that had the OData Metadata Parser that came from this Slickgrid-Universal [Discussion](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/discussions/578). The code is using a very old version of Slickgrid-Universal v0.10.2, so a separate repo was created for reference.

Head over to the [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal) project for up to date features.
